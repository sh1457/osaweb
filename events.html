												<h3>The Formation of the OSA</h3>
											</header>
											<p>25 years back, LFPS started in a humble way; in a small place we called 'School'. The two and thirty toddlers who came for their first day were in tears, knowing not, what to expect; but she took them in, determined to see them one day as confident teenagers. Slowly, more came in and we formally became a 'Big School'. With the little amenities that the small building could give us, we were most happy... playing, learning, talking, crying and we loved our family, friends and teachers.</p>
      <p>Oh! What Days they were!</p>
<p>Leaving school was a dreadful thing to all who were in it, even if they were prepared to take on the world, as there existed a bond that could neither be broken nor ignored. It tied the school with all the hundreds of students who have passed out of these portals. That bond brought them all back as one batch called for a massive reunion of all the batches that have passed out of LFPS since its inception through a dream conceived and made true by the ambitious Batch of 2005/06 (X Std), its own Alumni Association and is now successful. June 24th 2006 was the formal birth of the Old Students' Association, Little Flower Public School.</p>
<p>In a ceremony to launch the association and induct its first executive committee, OSA took birth. With a membership of 400 old students the association quickly grew under able leadership and was poised to reunite all the past students of LFPS.</p>
<p>It got registered under the Karnataka State Societies Registration Act, 1960 in June 2007 and was officially born. The motto of the association is “El Valor, La Connaissance” meaning “It's Bravery, it's Knowledge”.</p>
<p>The official Presidential Pledge, ceremonially taken by the President of the Association upon induction reads:</p>
<p>“This Will, shall bond us, while Lord Almighty, our Bonder, This plea pleadeth, what the heaven doth embrace, Thus, this bind, bindeth what Earthly Beings Being, Through this Chronicle, this Moment, this Day, I….on behalf of the Old Students Association, Little Flower Public School, pledge my Will and Life in serving my Alma Mater. I swear that the Association shall strive, not only for the prosperity and integrity, but also for perpetuating the values inculcated in us.”</p>
<p>The OSA meets every year at the Annual General Body Meeting. It also organizes a myriad of events like quizzes for the present students of LFPS. It is a promising and able organization under the Little Flower wing.The OSA plans to launch a website providing services that support Alumni Networking and useful resources that aid in interaction between Alumni, Alma Mater and Teachers. To improve Alumni and Students interaction through Mentoring and Career coaching programs. To organize an excursion for the Alumni and "Nirvana" the fest of Little Flower Public School.</p>

												<h3>Excelsior 2014</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The 2014 Edition of the Annual School Quiz, Excelsior kept us all warm in today's rainy weather. We were taken aback by the support the Finalists got from their Houses, the cheers the Teachers got when their faces came onscreen. Ruby came out on TOP, Topaz following right behind them, and then Emerald and Sapphire. We loved the atmosphere there today, we hope to do it again soon.</p>
